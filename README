This is a github repo of my Sysadmin detection scripts.

This task is about analyzing what commands the users of an IT system use during their work. The
main question to investigate is whether it is possible to distinguish between users based on their
usage of commands.

These were written on Ubuntu 16.04 64bit OS using R and BASH scripts

Dependent tools should be installed prior to usage:
  ~$ sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64,i386] https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial/'
  ~$ sudo apt-get update
  ~$ sudo apt-get install parallel jq mawk sed coreutils python-pip r-base
  ~$ sudo pip install csvkit
